# Readme #

This repo contains the scripts and data used in my Whereconf 2012 presentation titled "The Deadpool and Also-Rans"

## Scripts ##

The scripts use a fork of the tylercunnion's crunchbase gem (https://github.com/spara/crunchbase) to retrieve data from CrunchBase and print them as a comma delimited line to stdout. They are rough and quick scripts meant to be modified as needed.

Also included are two R scripts. Hierarchical.r is cribbed directly from http://heuristically.wordpress.com/2011/04/08/text-data-mining-twitter-r/ and crunchbase.r is based on http://www.cloudstat.org/index.php?do=/kaichew/blog/crunchbase-api-scrapping-companies-info-from-crunchbase-with-r-packages/

## Data ##

data.csv is the data used for the analysis
category is the list of location related companies retrieved from Crunchbase
